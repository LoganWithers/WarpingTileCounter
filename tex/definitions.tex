\subsection{Determining the starting value }

...therefore, let $d = \floor*{\frac{k}{2}}$, $m = \ceil*{\left(\frac{N}{102}\right)^{\frac{1}{d}}}$,
$l = \ceil{\log m} + 2$, $s = m^d - \floor*{\frac{N - 12l - 94}{12l + 90}}$, where $d$ is the
number of digits per row of the counter, $m$ is the base of the counter, $l$ is the number of bits
needed to encode each digit in binary plus 2 for indicating whether a digit is in the MSR and is the
MSD in that region, and $s$ is the starting value of the counter in decimal.

In general, the height of a digit region is $12l + 90$. There is one exception, being the seed row, which
has a height of $12l + 94$.
Let $h$ be the height of the construction before any filler/roof tiles are added. If we define
$\countersize$ as the number of \texttt{Counter} unit rows, then
$h = \countersize (12l + 90) + (12l + 94)$. So then the maximum height of the counter is
$m^d (12l + 90) + 12l + 94$. Since our goal is to end with a rectangle of height $N$, we need to pick a
base such that the counter can increment so many times that when it stops, it is at least $N$.

\begin{lemma} $N \leq m^d (12l + 90) + 12l + 94$.
    \begin{proof}
        \begin{flalign*}
            N & = 102 \left( \frac{N}{102} \right) = 102 \left(\left( \frac{N}{102} \right)^{\frac{1}{d}} \right)^d
                      \leq 102 \ceil*{\left( \frac{N}{102} \right)^{\frac{1}{d}} }^d \\
              & = 102m^d \leq 12lm^d + 90m^d \leq 12lm^d + 90m^d + 12l + 94 \\
              & = m^d (12l + 90) - 12l + 94
        \end{flalign*}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}


\subsection{Filling in the gaps}

...this means that the number of \texttt{Counter} unit rows $\countersize$ is $m^d - s$,
where we have \mbox{defined} $s$ as the starting value of the counter. To
choose the best starting value, \mbox{ we find the value for $\countersize$ that gets $h$ as
close to $N$} without exceeding $N$. It follows from the equation $h = \countersize (12l+90)+12l+94$,
that $\countersize = \counterrows$. Thus, $s = m^d - \counterrows$. As a result of
each digit requiring a width of 2 tiles, if $k$ is odd, one additional tile column must be added.
The number of filler tiles needed for the width is $k \mod 2$, and the number of filler tiles for
the height is $N - 12l - 94 \mod 12l + 90$.
